										<p>Various issues militating against satisfying the housing needs of Nigerians will become focal points at this year’s edition of the International ASO Housing Exhibition and Conference, slated for April 11, 12 and 13 at the International Conference Centre, Abuja.</p>
										<p>During the first two of the three day event, locally-based and international experts in the housing value chain will extensively deliberate on four salient topics, namely;Funding, Housing Delivery and Infrastructure ,Mortgages and Legislation.</p>
										<p>The conference will be attended by stakeholders in the housing industry from the public and private sectors of the economyincludingnational policy makers, Federal and State government representatives, real estate investors, professional mortgage providers, urban and Regional planners, Home developers, Architects, State &amp; Federal Housing Authorities, house buyers and other members of the general public.</p>
										<p>Themed "Achieving Affordable Housing Delivery by creating 500,000 housing units by 2016";the initiative was conceived to create an effective template for addressing the chronic housing shortage as well as poor access to housing finance in the country.This is with a view to create a roadmap for private and public sector partnership for attaining the vitally important Vision 2020 objective of the Federal Government of Nigeria of providing affordable homes for all Nigerians.</p>
										<p>It is salutary that such collaborations and objectives are in line with and complementary to President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan’s government’s Transformation Agenda in the areas of infrastructural and housing development. This is more so because the government at several forahas called for private sector participation in the attainment of its economic transformation goals.</p>
										<p>Speaking at the last Presidential Stakeholders’ Retreat at the Presidential Banquet Hall, Abuja, President Jonathan noted that inequitable access to land for housing development and inadequacy of housing in view of the national housing deficit estimated at about 16 to 17 million units, had remained a critical challenge to all stakeholders in the sector.</p>
										<p>In his view, if the deficit is to be bridged, ways must be soughtto provide affordable housing, especially to the non-income, low income, lower-middle income and informal sector worker. All these, he said, can only be achieved if developers in the private sector are ready to partner and complement government efforts.</p>
										<p>With the exhibition progressing simultaneously; panellists including; Evans Kofi Essienyi of the Affordable Housing Institute, Ghana; Dr. DelphineSangodeyiof AHI North and West Africa Associates, Paris; Stephen Terseer ABAR1st Vice President, Nigerian Bar Association, Lagos; Kayode Omotosho Executive Secretary, MBAN, Lagos and a host of other distinguished speakers will present on the four salient topics at four distinct sessions. While the session onFundingwould consider among other issues avenues of securing funding for the creation of 500,000 housing units as well as the development of public/private partnership models for the realization of this project, the Delivery and Infrastructure would explore current developments in innovative construction and building methodscapable of creating Nigeria-specific dwellings affordable by the majority of the populace.</p>
										<p>The panel on Mortgages would for illustration examine the latest thoughts among regulators and practitioners on implementing effective and sustainable framework for mortgage lending in Nigeria, addressing capital rules, responsible lending, and consumer protection. Finally, the Legal panelists would consider among other issues, the contemporary relevance of the Land Use Act 1978 in the context of land use, development and maintenance of a of reliable land database nationwide, property ownership rights, title, foreclosure etc. in the context of supporting the delivery of affordable housing.</p>
										<p>The 2013 annual ASO National Housing Exhibition &amp; Conference aims among others things, to come up with a communiqué that could assist stakeholders in the Nigerian housing industry, mould appropriate policy framework for housing development. The event promises a worthwhile experience for all participants including opportunities for attendees to the exhibition to shop for the homes of their dreams at the nation’s premier housing trade fair.</p>
										<p>ASO Savings &amp; Loans Plc is Nigeria’s leading Primary Mortgage Institution (PMI) with a vision of being “<i>…the mortgage bank of choice</i>, and operating by "<i>…build[ing] mutually profitable relationships anchored on a passion for excellence</i>".</p>
