								<ul> 
									<li>
										<p style="margin-top:20px;">The Management of ASO Savings &amp; Loans Plc. announced that, after a thorough investigation, the bank has successfully ensured the arrest of a fraudulent member of its Staff by the Naval Police, on the grounds of impersonation.</p>
										<p>This incident occurred on Wednesday July 9, 2014 at the ASO Corporate Head Office located on Central Business District Abuja. The apprehended Staff, Mr. Simon Musa, claimed to be a brother to one  Rear Admiral Musa in the Nigerian Navy, but suspicions were raised in the Bank after Mr. Simon Musa made a demand for kickback which the Management found strange. The Management then requested for a thorough investigation into Mr. Musa’s transactions and dealings with the Navy and subsequently reported its suspicions to the Office of the Chief of Naval Staff. The Bank, in collaboration with a Naval police team, then organized a sting operation and the Staff was apprehended.</p>
										<p>Mr. Musa is currently in the Naval Police custody for questioning and further prosecution.</p>
										<p>ASO Savings remains committed to protecting the interests of its customers by consistently ensuring only responsible and competent Staff are retained in its work force.</p>

This development is part of our business vision planned for the company this year&quot;.</p>
										<p>Usman further stated that &quot;we will be revealing more information about the expansion plans in the coming weeks. However, with our solid capitalisation, asset base and capital projects across the country in partnership with both states and federal governments, we have grown so much in equity and capital base.
