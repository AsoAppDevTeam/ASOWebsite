He made this known at a conference on Shelter and Urban Renewal, held recently to commemorate the World Habitat Day.

According to him, less than 30,000 housing units are developed every year as against the annual demand of between 500,000 to 1,000,000 by Nigerians. He added that the absence of viable quality mass housing developers and the reluctance of Banks to fund residential real estate among other factors, contributes largely to this challenge.

Enumerating on incentives that are needed to boost the Housing Sector, Mr. Hassan said access to inexpensive lands, 5 year Tax holiday for Mass Housing developers, Mortgage Interest Relief and the creation of a N250BN origination fund will go a long way. He advocated that allowing PMIs access to CBN discount window and the foreign exchange market would encourage better mortgage creation. Added to this, allowing investments by PMIs and Banks in mortgage assets and mortgage backed securities to count as part of their liquidity reserve requirements whilst allowing recapitalized PMIs to go to clearing House were noted by the MD as potential spurs to further the provision of mortgages.

Mr. Hassan concluded that to reduce the current Housing crisis in Nigeria, a critical intervention is required to increase Housing Finance from 1% to 5% of GDP within the next 5 years.</description><link>http://www.asoplc.com/pages/media/#news32</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Oct 2011 13:34:54 GMT</pubDate><source></source><category></category><guid></guid><enclosure length="0" type="application/dvcs"/></item><item><title>ASO sponsors Emir of Kano Golf Tournament
