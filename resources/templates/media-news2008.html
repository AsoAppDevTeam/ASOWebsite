										<li>
											<p>ASO Savings &amp; Loans PLC one of Nigeria's fastest growing mortgage Institutions yesterday bolstered its commitment to providing affordable housing for Nigerians as it signed a $5 million line of credit from Shelter Afrique which will be used to fund six small scale housing projects within the Federal Capital Territory.</p>
											<p>At the colourful signing ceremony held at Transcorp Hilton Hotel in Abuja, the Managing Director ASO Savings &amp; Loans PLC, Hassan Musa Usman said the bank had looked forward to the event with great expectations which he maintains opens a new chapter in the bank's history in its quest for leadership in the mortgage/housing finance sector of the nation's economy.</p>
											<p>&quot;<em>When we commenced our transformation drive nearly 3 years ago, we identified the need for strategic relationships with institutions such as Shelter Afrique as instrumental in achieving our objective of affordable housing in Nigeria; today we witness the realisation of this strategic initiative, which has bolstered our confidence and resolve to forge ahead with initiatives aimed at meeting the ever increasing need for affordable housing in Nigeria</em>&quot;, Hassan said.</p>
											<p>ASO Savings, he maintained, had carved a niche for itself in the nation's housing sector, more so &quot;at a time when most financial institutions are reluctant to finance mortgages, the bank is proud to have assisted well over 11,000 families to own their homes by providing mortgages worth over N40 billion, in addition to funding several developers in order to expand the supply of mortgageable homes.&quot;</p>
											<p>He disclosed that the initial $5 million will be used for the construction of 44 housing units targeted at the middle income bracket, adding that ASO Savings was optimistic that future collaborations would provide access to the tune of $30 million from Shelter Afrique in the medium term including the expertise and experience of Shelter Afrique in delivering housing solutions in Africa.</p>
											<p>The Chairman, ASO Savings &amp; Loans PLC, Abdu Mukhtar said the housing sector in Nigeria holds so much promise in spite of the global economic crisis and assured that the sector will continue to be a robust sector in Nigeria, while also pledging the bank's preparedness to be a global player by building on the relationship with Shelter Afrique and similar institutions across the globe.</p>
											<p>Managing Director Shelter Afrique, Mazi Osita Okonkwo said his organisation chose to partner with Aso Savings given its size, programmes and products which stands it out as a very strong Mortgage Institution and a finance power house for middle and low income earners.</p>
											<p>Okonkwo noted that Shelter Afrique was not only providing the credit facility but intends to build a relationship with ASO Savings in which both organisations will exchange experience over time.</p>
											<p>Shelter Afrique based in Kenya he said is owned by African governments with Nigeria as member and is delivering housing products to people in 42 countries through private and public institutions on the Continent.</p>
